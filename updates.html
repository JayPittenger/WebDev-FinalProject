                This week I started with VR development in Unity! I was able to get the camera rig set up in Unity such that 6DOF motion is tracked in VR and the controllers are tracked as well.
                Oculus provides an SDK for Unity which provides alot of prefab models and game objects that help you get set up in developing your VR application. I also followed a tutorial on 
                learn.unity.com which teaches Unity VR fundamentals, and learned how to create teleportation in VR to allow for movement over the game scene. Exciting stuff! Next I plan to begin 
                experiementing with writing my own scripts for game mechanics such as grabbing objects, or moving objects in VR space.

                I feel like I am beginning to make progress in learning Unity and scripting for game development in C#. My focus up to this point has been just learning the tools
                as well as gaining my game development legs so to speak, just in the context of basic 3D model interaction in a traditional PC game sense. I will likely focus on this
                for another week or so before diving into integrating VR SDKs such as Oculus and SteamVR into Unity. I am having a hard time focusing on the basics however, as I 
                am itching to put the headset on and start experimenting with VR in Unity. I also would like to add that for the purpose of my goals for game development at this time,
                and the scope of this website, I do not plan to dive into animation of 3D models or the creation of 3D assets on my own at this time. I plan to just use 3D assets provided
                from tutorials as well as open source 3D assets through the Unity asset store.

                Today I set up something very exciting! Through third party software, The Oculus Quest headset is capable of running PCVR content wirelessly. To do this, 
                I set up a second router and plugged this into my modem. Next, I connected an ethernet cable between my PC and the newly plugged in router. I also connected
                to this router's wireless connection on my Quest. Then I opened the third party software, called Virtual Desktop, on my PC which allows the PC to 
                be discoverable by the Oculus Quest when you run the Virtual Desktop app on the Quest on the same network (in my case, this is on the second router I mentioned). 
                This combination allows the user to stream their desktop to the Queest which is a neat experience. However, what makes this setup extremely useful is that it 
                allows you to run Oculus and SteamVR content wirelessly from your PC to your Quest heatset. I was quite impressed with the low latency from this setup. Even though 
                there is noticable visual compression in comparison to using a wired connection, it is still a great configuration if you want to ditch the wire for alittle while!
                Head over to the Software page of my website to find a link to the Virtual Desktop website. Alright, now to get back to work on learning game development :)

                Another day spent on the basics! I again focused on learning C# syntax. It seems that Unity scripting puts a significant focus on object oriented design
                which makes it easy to reference various game objects and data from other scripts. I think one of the hardest parts will be learning the integration between 
                the Unity UI and scripts. After working on game development foundational knowledge, I also focused on getting my USB drivers set up on my new PC so that the 
                wired connection between my Oculus Quest and my PC was stable.

                Today I installed the Unity 3D game development platform on my newly built PC and began learning C# syntax. I also focused on learning script integration 
                between Visual Studio and Unity, and how to assign scripts to particular 3D objects in Unity. I found out that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Unity is offering free
                premium access to their Learn platform, which contains a significant amount of courses, tutorials and projects to utilize when learning game development as well VR 
                development and other sub topics of game development. Head over to the Resources page of my website to find a link to Unity Learn. I will likely be spending a significant
                amount of time taking courses and following tutorials utilizing Unity Learn.
