            Below are summaries of software that I use for Virtual Reality (VR) development as well as gaming and utilizing applications in VR. Click the images to go to the website for that software.

                        <h2>Unity</h2>
                        Unity is a game development software that can be used to develop games for a significant number of platforms. It has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to help create, assign, and manipulate objects in your game scene.
                        It has integration with Visual Studio for scripting and allows direct ties between the scripts and the GUI that utilizes Object Oriented Design.

                        <h2>Visual Studio</h2>
                        Visual Studio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used to write code in many different languages. It has many developent features such as source code editor, debugging etc. It is the primary supported IDE for
                        Unity which is why I am using it for learning VR development.

                        <h2>Virtual Desktop</h2>
                        Although this is not software I directly use for development, Virtual Desktop allows me to wirelessly stream content from my PC to my Oculus Quest headset. This is great for virtual desktop uses, as well as wirelessly streaming
                        VR content to my headset for teatherless PC VR.

                        <h2>SideQuest</h2>
                        SideQuest is software that was created to allow users to have direct access to the Android backend of the Oculus Quest headset in order to load their own content onto the headset. This allows me to test other's software or experiences
                        that have not been added to the offical Oculus store.
