            <h2>Introduction and Project Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Hello and welcome to Jay's Virtual Reality! I'm Jay, and I am currently a university student about half way through the completion of my undergraduate
                Computer Science program at Oregon State University. Over the next few months I am taking on an extracurricular project of learning Virtual Reality (VR) 
                game development. The purpose of this website is to discuss virtual reality (VR) development and document my personal progress on this learning journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                On this website, the Updates page contains periodic updates on my game development learning progress, The Software page contains more detail on the software 
                tools I am utilizing, and the Resources page contains content and links to resources that I used for learning game development and VR development. For this 
                learning project, I plan to primarly focus on learning VR development with Unity, which is a popular 3D game development platform with significant learning 
                resources online as well as significant support and integration with Oculus. This is important, as the VR headset I plan to use for testing is an Oculus Quest. 
                I chose the Oculus Quest primarily because I already own one, but also because it allows me to test native PC VR applications as well as mobile VR applications 
                as it is both a standalone VR system as well as a PCVR headset. For more detail on the Unity development platform, please visit the Software page of this website. 
                I don't plan to go into too much detail on the Oculus Quest hardware on this website, but if you would like to learn more about the hardware I am using for this 
                learning project, I have added a link to the Oculus Quest product page. Thank you for visiting!
